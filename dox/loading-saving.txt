Going to and from app files

NEEDS:
	- need to be able to mix HTML with our custom tags
	- would love to do this with namespaces
	- need to put generated HTML into custom tags when taking over objects
	- need to ignore generated HTML when saving

	== must keep custom tags in the HTML so we can save the page


Strategy:
	- have a single <hope> custom tag, so you'd do:
		<hope type='Button'>...</hope>
		
	- Content in a hope object that should not be saved should have save='false' in the parent hope object?
	
	- They can manipulate the page via the IDE or firebug all they want

	- On save, we ignore all generated content (somehow)
	

HMMMM
	 - if we assume that they are creating their content with a tool,
	 	do we need to allow them to embed arbitrary HTML anywhere?
	 - what if we give them an 'htmlContainer' object to put arbitrary HTML into
	 	and we ignore it everywhere else?
	 	
	 ? how can we do skins?
	 	- skin is a encompassing HTML container
	 	- maybe it's an overlay and we locate the app pieces in the skin via id?
	 	- don't need to allow them to edit the skin in the IDE (??)
